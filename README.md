PHP Docker for Woocommerce on Steroids

## Why?

I didn't find any Automated Build that was offering such a simple docker in the whole Hub, so I decided to create it myself.
This Docker should serve as a starting point for self-hosting a personal Wordpress/WooCommerce installation.

## What is included?

- Apache + PHP 7.4 + VOLUME ( thanks to https://hub.docker.com/_/php/ ) + [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/)
- Some PHP extensions enabled ( see below )
- Apache mod_rewrite enabled

## Which PHP extensions come pre-loaded?

```php
// print_r( get_loaded_extensions() );
